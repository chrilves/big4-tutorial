   named objects and vertices named arrows. Each arrow goes
   from an object to an object (possibly the same!). -}

  {- For each object, there is an arrow called `id` which
    goes from the object to itself. -}

      `g` from `b` to `c`. We can compose these arrow. The

      composing f with g, and then the result with h
      gives exatctly the same result as
      composing f with the result of the composition of g and h

      Which means, like string concatenation than we can commpose
      the way we preserve the order of each element in the sequence.-}
